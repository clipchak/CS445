Purpose: To give you experience implementing and using linked data structures.

Goal 1: To design and implement a class LinkedDS<T> that will act as a linked data structure for accessing Java Objects. Your LinkedDS<T> class will primarily implement two interfaces â€“ PrimQ<T> and Reorder. The details of these interfaces are explained in the files PrimQ.java and Reorder.java. Read these files over very carefully before implementing your LinkedDS<T> class.

Goal 2: To utilize your LinkedDS<T> class to store and manipulate arbitrary length hexadecimal numbers. We can think of a hexadecimal number as a sequence of hexadecimal digits. For example, the number BEEF could be stored as the digit 'B' followed by the digit 'E' followed by the digit 'E' followed by the digit 'F'. We can store these digits in an array, or, as is required in this assignment, in a linked
chain. Clearly, to perform operations on a number that is stored in this fashion, we must access the digits one at a time in some systematic way. More specific details follow below.
