# CS445
Projects coded in Java for Pitt's CS445 Data Structures class


**Project 1 - design and implement a simple class MultiDS<T> 
that will act as a data structure for accessing Java Objects, implement a simple version of the card game "Snap"**

**Project 2 - design and implement a class LinkedDS<T> that will act as a linked data structure for accessing Java Objects, 
utilize LinkedDS<T> class to store and manipulate arbitrary length hexadecimal numbers**

**Project 4 - tested 9 different sorting algorithms, counting number of comparisons and data movements of each
sort in different situations on different size arrays**

**Project 5 - utilize a pre-made Huffman compression tree to compress and decompress selected text strings.**
