Purpose and Goal:
We have discussed binary trees (BTs) and you will utilize them in a rough implementation of a famous compression algorithm: Huffman Compression. In this program you will utilize a pre-made Huffman compression tree to compress and decompress selected text strings.

In this assignment, you must do the following:
1) Read in a representation of a Huffman tree from a text file and generate a Huffman tree of binary nodes.
2) Use the tree generated in 1) above to create a Huffman encoding table.
3) Initiate an interactive session with the user that will continue until the user elects to quit.
