Purpose: To refresh your Java programming skills and to emphasize the object-oriented programming approach used in Java. Specifically, you will work with control structures, class-building, interfaces and generics to create and utilize a simple array-based data structure.

Goal 1: To design and implement a simple class MultiDS<T> that will act as a simple data structure for accessing Java Objects. Your MultiDS<T> class will primarily implement 2 interfaces â€“ PrimQ<T> and Reorder. The details of these interfaces are explained in the files PrimQ.java and Reorder.java. Read these files over very carefully before implementing your MultiDS<T> class.

Goal 2: To utilize your MultiDS<T> class by implementing a simple version of the card game "Snap". In this case your program will be a client using MultiDS<T> and the details of the MultiDS<T> implementation will be abstracted out.
